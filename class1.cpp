/*NOTE FIRST CLASS 
 *  * What is a variable ?
 *  2. How many primative types?
 *  3. WHat is a statement ?
 *  4. What is an expression ?
 *  5. What is a selection statemtent ?
 *  6. WHat is a switch block ?
 *
 *  In this class 50 to 60 % it will be about coding the rest will include data structure.
 *  Practice will be based on assignments - take notes,ask questions 
 *  We will be using piazza to ask questions, emial and office hours. 
 *  In blackboard theres self practice assignments - no points just for practice 
 *  For assignments theres a bar to reach to obtain point for it, if the bar is not reached then 
 *  you will not receive credit.
 *
 *  TIME AND EFFORT - I NEEED AN A 
 *  Before all classes review class notes. 
 *  Office hours 8-208 after class.

/*NOTE SECOND CLASS
 * A.Topics
 * Data structure - specification,design, implementation and use of basic data types
 *    1. arrays
 *    2. list 
 *    3. queues
 *    4.tress ... 
 * OOP AND C++ - clases, container, classes ,big tree
 * Standard templete libary - templetes, iterators
 *
 * Data structure is the organization of data in memory. Put boundaries on memory to 
 * seperate part of memory to have faster acesss of memory.
 * Store data in a specific place and later retrieve that data.
 * Goal : Have fast access to the data and store as less as possible.
 * In this cource we assume that there is a computer with unlimited random access storage and 
 * processing power. 
 *     - random acess means having acess to to any location of the storage at any time.
 * Using this model we compare the performnace of different data structures 
 *     -during this course we assume our computing model has a single computational node
 * Data structures are not compared in different computers, we do it scientfically. 
 * You can't compare data structures with time
 *     - we do it with the number of steps of the data structure. 
 *     - size of input is very important
 *     -e.g if you have n  elements unsorted the its averag3 : n/2
 *     - if the list is already sorted - average: is log (n )
 *
 * B. What is data structures ?
 *  -data sturcture is the organization of data in the storage and the acess method to the data
 *  -organization of data is how physical data is stored. It is not related to the hardware storage
 *  (Data structures might be designed for a specific type of hardware storage though)
 *  -acess method means how the stored data will be accessed (inset, read , update, delte,..) 
 *  the running time prefor these access methods is very important. 
 *  e.g of data structure : arrays, linked list, tress.
 * 
 * Real world examples
 * 1. a building can be seen as a structure, it has multiple floors and each floor may have multiple units, each 
 * unit also may have multiple rooms.
 * 2.To have access to a specific unit you have to know the floor number of the unit. Then have access to the floor
 * using an elevator and have access ot the unit by knowing the number of the unit.
 * 3. data structures is similar, e.g if you know that you have stored a specific number in the 10th location of a linked
 * list then you need to have access to that location using a specific algorithm that runs on each link until it reaches  
 * the specific location. 
 *
 * C. What is algorithm?
 * data structure can't be define without algorihtm.
 * 1. its a step by step procedure with a specific goal
 * 2. the input of the an algorith is called the input instance and is an input of the correct algorithm algorithm halts on 
 * the correct output.
 * 3. During this course I dont talk about parallel algorithms so the default assumption is our algorithms 
 * run on a single processor. 
 * 4. A randomized algorith is a special type of algorithm that has random steps this either the running time, or the output 
 *  are random.
 *
 *  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Sorting%20Algorithms/sorting.html    // some sorting algorithms. 
 *  
 * D . What do you need to know before designing a data structure? 
 *  - what is the max number of elements 
 *  - what is the max size of the data
 *  - what is the infastructure that the data structure is going to be used on (e.g #of processors,type,speed,memory size,..)
 *  - how often the data structure is going to be accessed and what is the type of access
 *  - is there any power constraints.
